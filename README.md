Nancy.Serialization.Jil
=======================

Implementations of the ISerialization and IBodyDeserializer interfaces, based on [Jil](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/Jil), for [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org). Because a little bit more [Performance](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/Jil/blob/master/README.md#benchmarks) never hurts.

## Usage

tbd.


## Limitations

As this library is based on [Jil](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/Jil), all its Features but also Limitations also apply here: >= .Net 4.5 is required, but even more so please take a close look at its [List of supported types](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/Jil/blob/master/README.md#supported-types) and how to [configure and tailor Jil](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/Jil/blob/master/README.md#configuration) to your specific environment and use case.

## Thanks

This is basically a 1:1: port of [Nancy.Serialization.JsonNet](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy.Serialization.JsonNet) but replacing the [Json.NET](http://json.codeplex.com/) parts with Jil. So thanks to Andreas Håkansson, Steven Robbins and the other original contributors.

Moreover thanks alot to [Kevin](https://github.com/kevin-montrose) for his awesome work on [Jil](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/Jil).
